# FishTracker
This program has been designed to detect and track Zebra fishes in an experimental setup for Neuroscience research.
Live video is captured and the position of the fish is calculated in realtime.The calculated distance is time stamped and logged.
The log data is plotted as a heat map to show the patterns in movement and the amount of time spend at different sides.
